# DoD project

This project is part of the milestone project Design och Data and is testing a Speckle connection to DTCV

## Todo 1

- Login to Speckle server
- Load a stream prefilled with 3CIM data
- Change the object attribute "type" to any string value and commit back to Speckle

## Todo 2

- Load data from Grasshopper and find alignment of object positions
- Figure out how to combine Speckle branches so that data can be separated but still merged

## Todo 3

- Try an editor for 2D shapes and see if a simple design workflow can be made where geometry is changed and commited
