# 3CIM

This project is a collaboration with Lund University and the cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂ for the Digital Twin City Viewer to support the CityGML/3CIM data developed in the project with the same name.

## Scope

The scope is here to show how CityGML could be loaded in the DTCV viewer. In the end the DTCV viewer should be able to load CityGML/CityJSON natively for viewing and analysis purposes.

## Development

The instructions on how to run the development environment will be written as the functionality get more stable. The DTCV project runs between 2022-2024.
