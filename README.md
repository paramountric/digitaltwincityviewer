# Digital Twin City Viewer

**An open source toolkit for collaborative right-time city data online**

The Digital Twin City Viewer is developed as part of the DTCC Platform, an open-source platform for the
exploration of digital twins for cities.

However, it's also designed to be used standalone or as a part of any other system setup that uses open standards for data exchange - DTCV Platform.

## Status

The DTCV project has been developed between 2022-2024 connected to projects in DTCC and other research projects.

The results have been shaped into a platform for prototyping and testing web applications for digital twin processes - DTCV Platform.

Follow-up projects are planned and updates will eventually end up here as information.

For further updates, see the commits to the repository branches and use the issue tracker for reporting bugs and feature requests.

## DTCC Platform

The DTCC Platform is developed and maintained by the Digital Twin Cities Centre (DTCC) hosted by Chalmers
University of Technology. The aim is to develop an open multimodal
data, modeling, simulation and visualization platform for interactive
planning, design, exploration, experimentation and optimization of cities.
