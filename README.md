# Digital Twin City Viewer

The Digital Twin City Viewer is developed as part of the DTCC Platform, an open-source platform for the
exploration of digital twins for cities. However, it's also designed to be used standalone or as a part of any other system setup that uses open standards for data exchange.

**A core feature of the Digital Twin City Viewer is that it enables "right-time" data sharing in a decentralized fashion.**

## DTCC Platform

The DTCC Platform is developed and maintained by the Digital Twin Cities Centre (DTCC) hosted by Chalmers
University of Technology. The aim is to develop an open multimodal
data, modeling, simulation and visualization platform for interactive
planning, design, exploration, experimentation and optimization of cities.

## Getting started

The Digital Twin City Viewer is expected to be released in a first stable version in the end of 2022. The documentation will be developed until then as more and more features will be released in alpha.
