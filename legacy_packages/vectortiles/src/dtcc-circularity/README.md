# Example

The tiles from the DTCC Circularity project is generated using the code in this folder.

Since the tiles are pre-generated it made more sense to put the code in the vectortiles package for reference.

The functionality of the vectortiles package is rarely used at the application level, it's for running the tiles in an automated process (or even manually)

NOTE: data folder is not checked into source code
