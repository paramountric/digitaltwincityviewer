# Viewer module

This module is the foundation of the Digital Twin City Viewer. It provides a WebGL canvas and a specific event API to interact with your custom GUI components.

See the `projects` folder for examples on how to create a custom viewer.

# Work in progress

- Create a wrapper around setProps with helper functions
- Dependency injection for layer classes
- Some common custom layers built-in, as well as exposing the built-in Deck layers through JSON converter logic
