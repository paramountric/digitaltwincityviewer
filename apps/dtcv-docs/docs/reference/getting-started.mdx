# Getting started

The platform is only used if you need backend services like authentication, database, realtime, workflows, Speckle integration, DTCC Core or file storage.

If you only want to develop a viewer frontend application you can skip the platform, and look into the examples on how to use Next.js, React and viewer components.

## Preparations

The DTCV Platform needs a Docker environment to run locally on your machine.

It's recommended to use [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the platform inside the virtual machine.

You also need to have Node.js, pnpm and Supabase CLI installed on your machine.

## Run the platform

When the Docker environment is ready, clone the code from the github repository and run

```bash
pnpm i
```

You also need to create a .env file in the platform directory. Use the env-example file as a starting point.

Then to start the platform run:

```bash
pnpm run platform:start
```

This will take some time but start all services.

:::warning
Remember to stop the platform after you are finished with development:

```bash
pnpm run platform:stop
```

:::

## Run a viewer app

The simplest example is to use the dtcv-auth app. It shows:

- how to create a user and login
- an example of the viewer component
- some UI components like a sidebar

To run this example app, first take a look at the environment variables in example.env and make a copy of the file into .env.local.

Then add the environment variables for the platform.

:::info
The environment variables for the platform is the one you added when you configured the platform above.

The to start the app run:

```bash
pnpm run dev:dtcc-auth
```
