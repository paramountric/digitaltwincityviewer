# Explore the database

With the platform running, visit the Studio application at `http://localhost:8000`.

In the "Table editor" you can see the public schema in the database, and this should be filled with the Speckle tables:

Note that there is a users table, which should be synced to the Supabase auth table users.

Speckle also has its "streams" table, which is analogous to "projects" - you can use this as project if you like the object model of Speckle.

You can see that the n8n schema is also in the dropdown:

The main entity of n8n is the "workflows" table, which contains the workflow definitions. You can upload these workflows through the [link]API and then trigger them through your application logic.

It is recommended to study the Supabase, Speckle and n8n documentntaion carefully to get the best out of the DTCV Platform.

## Database schema

This visualisation helps to navigate the database schema which you can access at `http://localhost:8000` and by clicking on the "Database" menu item.

As schemas related to several platforms are used in parallell in the same database instance, it is important to get familiar with the schema setup.

Unfortunately we did not find a way to put Speckle schemas into its own postgres schema, so they are currently in the public schema.

This means that you have to be careful when creating tables in the public schema, as you might overwrite existing Speckle schema structure.

## Database principles

### User mananagement

Supabase keeps the main auth in its own auth schema. You can find the base user here as internal user settings.

The user is synced to the users table in the public schema, provided by Speckle.

To sync the Supabase auth user to a custom user in the public schema is a common approach, and is usually done by a trigger function as the base user is created. This will automatically then create a user in the public schema.

You can use the supabase/migrations folder to add this kind of logic, but we kept the logic in the application code itself. See the example in the [link]auth documentation.

This is not considered as an equally stable solution, but is good for prototyping and have a clear overview of how the services are interconnected.

N8n is threated a bit differently. The user management is setup during installation of the platform and the credentials are stored in the .env file.

So this is more similar to how the admin user is managed in Supabase and means that you can upload and manage workflows programmatically in n8n without creating and additional user.

However, just like the Speckle user is syned to the Supabase user, it is possible to sync additional n8n users by using the n8n API.

We did not use the DTCV Platform to expose the workflows no code / low code interface for external users - only for the admin or "facilitator user". The additional users have access to the workflows through the n8n API as triggered by the custom DTCV App.

Read more about the n8n integration in the [link]n8n documentation.

### Project management

Normally you need the concept of a "project" to be able to manage different and separated datasets as connected to collaborators in a real world project or organisation.

As the Speckle Server uses the concept of a "stream" to manage data, we usually create a "project" table in the public schema.

This entity can be connected to one or several Speckle streams according to your application needs.

If you only need Speckle functionality, you can use the streams table directly as a project, as adding an extra table for project would be redundant.

You can also check out Speckle's offering as they have a separate "automate" functionality and a powerful viewer.
