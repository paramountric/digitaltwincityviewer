# Customisation

As part of building a set of reusable modules that enable custom viewers for digital twin city data and processes we have used an opinionated approach to the development of the platform.

:::info
The core idea is to use principles, frameworks and tools that are well established in the open source web development community to efficiently reuse and customise applications.
:::

## <IconCheckmark /> Viewer

The functionality that enables the visualisation of map data is essential.

Read more about the [viewer concepts here](/docs/core-concepts/viewer).

## <IconCheckmark /> Modules

As different viewers and use cases are developed and tested, we find common functionality that can be moved out as reusable modules.

Read more about the [modules here](/docs/core-concepts/modules).

This is also supported by the [monorepo setup of the platform](/docs/core-concepts/monorepo) that enables easy access to the modules from different applications.

## <IconCheckmark /> Local First

The use of local first workflows is a way to enable the functionality of the platform in a flexible way.

This enables both convenient prototyping but can also be part of local workflows in a decentralised setting.

## <IconCheckmark /> Platform

The platform should be thought of as a backbone of the application development process and consists of several backends and services.

The idea is to provide powerful access to database, real-time capabilities and to hook into open source ecosystems.

## <IconCheckmark /> Automation

The automation part of the platform is a way to enable running tasks and workflows as applications and services interact with each other.
